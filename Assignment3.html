    <b>Coffee</b> is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from
    certain <i>Coffea</i> species. The genus Coffea is native to tropical Africa (specifically having its
    origin in Ethiopia and Sudan) and Madagascar, the Comoros, Mauritius, and RÃ©union in the
    Indian Ocean.
    Dried coffee seeds (referred to as <q>beans</q>) are roasted to varying degrees, depending on
    the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and then brewed with near-boiling water to
    produce the beverage known as coffee.
